# Development Portfolio

Welcome to my development portfolio! I'm excited to showcase my work and skills in this field. Although I have a background in HR and customer relations, I have recently made a career change towards web design and development.



## About Me

In the past, I had the opportunity to gain multicultural work experience in HR and customer relation fields. However, my passion for web design and development has led me to pursue a career in this industry. I have successfully completed my education in web design and application development. I am passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications.
